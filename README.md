# ML
This module provides for the easiest way to implement Machine Learning algoritms without the need to know about them.

Use this module if
- You are a complete beginner to Machine Learning.
- You find other modules too complicated.

This module is not meant for high level tasks, but only for simple use and learning.

I would not recommend using this module for big projects.

This module uses a tensorflow backend.

Install by running
<br /><br />
`pip install ml-python`

install mtrack
